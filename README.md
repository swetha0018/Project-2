# Project-2
This project honestly opened my eyes as far as shell scripting goes. 
There were alot of tutorials in this project, such as File Names and permissions,
Script Execution, Relative vs. Absolute Path, A SImple Backup Shell Script, and Input, Output
and Error Redirections. 
I may have only listed a few tutorials, but all of them were essential in learning how to write shell
scripts. As i progressed through the tutorials, I learned more and more about the different functions
and techniques that can be used in writing shell scripts. I found most of the tutorial tasks to be easy,
but when I reached the backup.sh file, I encountered a few roadbloks. 
First off, I was unable to execute the command which required me to list the total files and 
total directories. It would continuously give me an error saying "No such file or directory".
I did a bit of debugging, but was unable to locate where the error was. This error led to a 
cascade of errors as the backup.sh file become more complex. I look forward to improving this code in 
the future and hopefully getting it to run properly. After all, working to improve my code and 
recognizing errors in code are probably two of the most important goals of this course. Hopefully,
I can learn to debug in a more efficient way and learn to minimize errors in my code.

Code Review - Faith Dobbs

Sadly I could not comment on all the neccessary elements, as there were not code blocks for three of the elements. I was able to commment on if-else.sh, as this was included. 

Although I couldn't leave many comments, the code was still very neatly typed and easy to navigate and find what I was looking for. My suggestion for improvement is to make sure that all the necessary code is included when you push to GitHub. Other than that, the code seems to be organized and appropriately laid out.
